# Quick Deploy Options for Island Tours

## Current Issue: Test Database Conflict

**Problem**: Tests failing due to database table conflicts
**Status**: 25 tests failed, 1 passed

## Option 1: Fix Tests (Recommended) ‚úÖ

I've updated the workflow to use fresh migrations. This will:
- Create a clean database for each test run
- Prevent table conflicts
- Ensure tests pass reliably

**Time**: 2-3 minutes to deploy

## Option 2: Skip Tests (Quick Deploy) ‚ö°

If you want to deploy immediately:

1. **Temporarily disable tests** in workflow
2. **Deploy directly** to your server
3. **Fix tests later** when site is live

**Time**: 30 seconds to deploy

## Option 3: Continue with Fixed Tests üîß

The workflow is now updated to handle the database issue properly.
