# Quick Deploy Option - Skip Tests Temporarily

## Current Situation
Tests are still failing due to database conflicts. We have two options:

## Option 1: Skip Tests and Deploy Now (Recommended)
- Get your site live immediately
- Fix tests later when site is working
- Takes 2-3 minutes

## Option 2: Continue Debugging Tests
- Keep trying to fix the database issue
- Risk more failed deployments
- Unknown time to resolve

## Let's Deploy Without Tests

Since your Laravel app is well-structured and we need to see it live, let's temporarily disable tests and deploy:

```yaml
# Simplified workflow - tests disabled temporarily
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Deploy to cPanel
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    
    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: '8.2'
    
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - name: Install PHP Dependencies
      run: composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader --no-interaction
    
    - name: Install NPM Dependencies
      run: npm ci
    
    - name: Build Assets
      run: npm run build
    
    # Deploy directly without tests
    - name: Deploy to cPanel via FTP
      uses: SamKirkland/FTP-Deploy-Action@v4.3.4
      with:
        server: ${{ secrets.FTP_HOST }}
        username: ${{ secrets.FTP_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.FTP_PASSWORD }}
        local-dir: './'
        server-dir: ${{ secrets.FTP_PATH || '/public_html/' }}
```

This will:
1. ✅ Build your assets
2. ✅ Deploy to your server
3. ✅ Get your site live immediately
4. ⏭️ Skip problematic tests

## Your Choice

Would you like me to:
1. **Deploy without tests now** (get site live in 3 minutes)
2. **Try one more test fix** (might take more attempts)

What do you prefer?
